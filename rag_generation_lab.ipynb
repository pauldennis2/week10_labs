With a typical LLM providing medical records, it would often get things right, but it would sometimes make bizarre mistakes that even someone with basic medical knowledge would question. And it would sound 100% confident while doing so. A regular generation model would tend to make claims like \"oh yes, I have your medical records right here\" when it has not been provided any information about the patient - because it thinks that is what it's supposed to say.\n",

Imagine if you overheard your doctor gossiping to another patient about **your** deeply person and private medical condition.
